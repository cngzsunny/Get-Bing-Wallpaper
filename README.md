Thanks for the following two authors in their own blogs which helped me to establish this script.

Get-Bing-Wallpaper.ps1 is the main power script file, you can run it in your powershell command line.

You can also place ChangeWallpaper.vbs into your startup menu to update your wallpaper silently while you login Windows.
